* Theory of Constraints (TOC) - Sir. Goldratt

** Core Idea
*** Every system has at least one constraint
*** Constraint limits system performance
*** Improve the constraint to improve the whole system
*** Local optimization does not optimize the system

** TOC Five Focusing Steps (Process)
*** 1. Identify the Constraint
**** Find what limits throughput
**** Can be internal or external

*** 2. Exploit the Constraint
**** Use the constraint efficiently
**** No major investment
**** Avoid waste on the constraint

*** 3. Subordinate Everything Else
**** Align all processes to support the constraint
**** Non-constraints must wait
**** Stop local optimization

*** 4. Elevate the Constraint
**** Increase constraint capacity
**** Investment, automation, policy change
**** Add resources if needed

*** 5. Repeat the Process
**** Once constraint moves, find the new one
**** Continuous improvement cycle
**** Avoid inertia

** TOC Thinking Processes (TP)
*** Purpose
**** Understand complex systems
**** Identify root causes
**** Resolve conflicts
**** Design sustainable change

*** Logical Thinking Validation Criteria
**** Clarity
**** Complete statements
**** Cause–effect validity
**** Sufficiency of cause
**** Alternative causes
**** No cause–effect reversal
**** Verifying effects
**** No tautology

*** Current Reality Tree (CRT)
**** Shows current state
**** Identifies Undesirable Effects (UDEs)
**** Links UDEs to Root Causes
**** Finds Core Problem (~70% UDEs)

*** Zones
**** Control Zone
**** Influence Zone
**** Uncontrollable Zone

*** Root Cause
**** Last controllable cause
**** May not be negative
**** Can be multiple

*** Core Problem
**** Root cause behind most UDEs
**** Solving it prevents recurrence

*** Conflict Resolution Tree (Evaporating Cloud)
**** Identifies hidden conflicts
**** Removes assumptions
**** Finds win–win solutions

*** Future Reality Tree (FRT)
**** Shows expected future after change
**** Validates solutions
**** Identifies negative branches

*** Transition Tree (TT)
**** Step-by-step actions
**** Links actions to outcomes
**** Ensures execution logic

*** Transformation Plan
**** Converts trees into execution roadmap
**** Assigns actions and priorities
