# Theory of Constraints

```

The Theory of Constraints is a methodology for identifying the most important limiting factor (i.e., constraint)
that stands in the way of achieving a goal and then systematically improving that constraint until it is no longer
the limiting factor. In manufacturing, the constraint is often referred to as a bottleneck.
